Ideas:

- ifxOpt class is the main controller and container that holds items added by user
- few default validation methods + possibility for user to pass functor to validate value


- add map that will remember argv index and matching optEntry (whether and when it was found)
- add unique switch, so that among few only one must be used
- add unique switch, so that among few at least one must be used
