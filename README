Ideas:

- ifxOpt class is the main controller and container that holds items added by user
- few default validation methods + possibility for user to pass functor to validate value


- option to set whether to use (allow) '=' or not
  AND whether to accept space between arg and value
- option to set if optEntry is mandatory or optional
- add some bool or whatever to state whether option value is mandatory or optional
- default value for each option?
- add map that will remember argv index and matching optEntry (whether and when it was found)
